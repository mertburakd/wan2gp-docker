## ðŸ”¥ Latest News!!
* May 26 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.31 : Added Phantom 14B, a model that you can use to transfer objects / people in the video. My preference goes to Vace that remains the king of controlnets.
* May 26 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.3 : Happy with a Video generation and want to do more generations using the same settings but you can't remember what you did or you find it to hard to copy / paste one per one each setting from the file metadata ? Rejoice ! There are now multiple ways to turn this tedious process into a one click task: 
    - Select one Video recently generated in the Video Gallery and click *Use Selected Video Settings*
    - Click *Drop File Here*  and select a Video you saved somewhere, if the settings metadata have been saved with the Video you will be able to extract them automatically
    - Click *Export Settings to File* to save on your harddrive the current settings. You will be able to use them later again by clicking *Drop File Here* and select this time a Settings json file  
* May 23 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.21 : Improvements for Vace: better transitions between Sliding Windows,Support for Image masks in Matanyone, new Extend Video for Vace, different types of automated background removal 
* May 20 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.2 : Added support for Wan CausVid which is a distilled Wan model that can generate nice looking videos in only 4 to 12 steps.
 The great thing is that Kijai (Kudos to him !) has created a CausVid Lora that can be combined with any existing Wan t2v model 14B like Wan Vace 14B.
 See instructions below on how to use CausVid.\
 Also as an experiment I have added support for the MoviiGen, the first model that claims to capable to generate 1080p videos (if you have enough VRAM (20GB...) and be ready to wait for a long time...). Don't hesitate to share your impressions on the Discord server.
* May 18 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.1 : Bonus Day, added LTX Video 13B Distilled: generate in less than one minute, very high quality Videos !
* May 17 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v5.0 : One App to Rule Them All !\
    Added support for the other great open source architectures:
    - Hunyuan Video : text 2 video (one of the best, if not the best t2v) ,image 2 video and the recently released Hunyuan Custom (very good identify preservation when injecting a person into a video)
    - LTX Video 13B (released last week): very long video support and fast 720p generation.Wan GP version has been greatly optimzed and reduced LTX Video VRAM requirements by 4 !

    Also:
    - Added supported for the best Control Video Model, released 2 days ago : Vace 14B
    - New Integrated prompt enhancer to increase the quality of the generated videos
    You will need one more *pip install -r requirements.txt*

* May 5 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.5: FantasySpeaking model, you can animate a talking head using a voice track. This works not only on people but also on objects. Also better seamless transitions between Vace sliding windows for very long videos (see recommended settings). New high quality processing features (mixed 16/32 bits calculation and 32 bitsVAE)
* April 27 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.4: Phantom model support, very good model to transfer people or objects into video, works quite well at 720p and with the number of steps > 30
* April 25 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.3: Added preview mode and support for Sky Reels v2 Diffusion Forcing for high quality "infinite length videos" (see Window Sliding section below).Note that Skyreel uses causal attention that is only supported by Sdpa attention so even if chose an other type of attention, some of the processes will use Sdpa attention. 

* April 18 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.2: FLF2V model support, official support from Wan for image2video start and end frames specialized for 720p.  
* April 17 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.1: Recam Master model support, view a video from a different angle. The video to process must be at least 81 frames long and you should set at least 15 steps denoising to get good results.
* April 13 2025: ðŸ‘‹ WanGP v4.0: lots of goodies for you !
    - A new UI, tabs were replaced by a Dropdown box to easily switch models
    - A new queuing system that lets you stack in a queue as many text2video, imag2video tasks, ... as you want. Each task can rely on complete different generation parameters (different number of frames, steps, loras, ...). Many thanks to **Tophness** for being a big contributor on this new feature
    - Temporal upsampling (Rife) and spatial upsampling (Lanczos) for a smoother video (32 fps or 64 fps) and to enlarge your video by x2 or x4. Check these new advanced options.
    - Wan Vace Control Net support : with Vace you can inject in the scene people or objects, animate a person, perform inpainting or outpainting, continue a video, ... I have provided an introduction guide below.
    - Integrated *Matanyone* tool directly inside WanGP so that you can create easily inpainting masks used in Vace
    - Sliding Window generation for Vace, create windows that can last dozen of seconds
    - New optimisations for old generation GPUs: Generate 5s (81 frames, 15 steps) of Vace 1.3B with only 5GB and in only 6 minutes on a RTX 2080Ti and 5s of t2v 14B in less than 10 minutes.

* Mar 27 2025: ðŸ‘‹ Added support for the new Wan Fun InP models (image2video). The 14B Fun InP has probably better end image support but unfortunately existing loras do not work so well with it. The great novelty is the Fun InP image2 1.3B model : Image 2 Video is now accessible to even lower hardware configuration. It is not as good as the 14B models but very impressive for its size. You can choose any of those models in the Configuration tab. Many thanks to the VideoX-Fun team  (https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun)
* Mar 26 2025: ðŸ‘‹ Good news ! Official support for RTX 50xx please check the installation instructions below. 
* Mar 24 2025: ðŸ‘‹ Wan2.1GP v3.2: 
    - Added Classifier-Free Guidance Zero Star. The video should match better the text prompt (especially with text2video) at no performance cost: many thanks to the **CFG Zero * Team:**\
    Dont hesitate to give them a star if you appreciate the results:  https://github.com/WeichenFan/CFG-Zero-star 
    - Added back support for Pytorch compilation with Loras. It seems it had been broken for some time
    - Added possibility to keep a number of pregenerated videos in the Video Gallery (useful to compare outputs of different settings)

    - You can save default settings in the files *i2v_settings.json* and *t2v_settings.json* that will be used when launching the app (you can also specify the path to different settings files)
    - Slight acceleration with loras\
    You will need one more *pip install -r requirements.txt*
    Many thanks to *Tophness* who created the framework (and did a big part of the work) of the multitabs and saved settings features 
* Mar 18 2025: ðŸ‘‹ Wan2.1GP v2.11: Added more command line parameters to prefill the generation settings + customizable output directory and choice of type of metadata for generated videos.

    - Very to use Loras as now Lora presets can input the subject (or other need terms) of the Lora so that you dont have to modify manually a prompt 
    - Added basic macro prompt language to prefill prompts with differnent values. With one prompt template, you can generate multiple prompts.
    - New Multiple images prompts: you can now combine any number of images with any number of text promtps (need to launch the app with --multiple-images)
    - New command lines options to launch directly the 1.3B t2v model or the 14B t2v model
* Mar 14, 2025: ðŸ‘‹ Wan2.1GP v1.7: 
    - Lora Fest special edition: very fast loading / unload of loras for those Loras collectors around. You can also now add / remove loras in the Lora folder without restarting the app. You will need to refresh the requirements *pip install -r requirements.txt*
    - Added experimental Skip Layer Guidance (advanced settings), that should improve the image quality at no extra cost. Many thanks to the *AmericanPresidentJimmyCarter* for the original implementation

## Installation Guide for Linux and Windows for GPUs up to RTX40xx

**If you are looking for a one click installation, just go to the Pinokio App store : https://pinokio.computer/**\
Otherwise you will find the instructions below:

This app has been tested on Python 3.10 / 2.6.0  / Cuda 12.4.

```shell
# 0 Download the source and create a Python 3.10.9 environment using conda or create a venv using python
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9
conda activate wan2gp

# 1 Install pytorch 2.6.0
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu124  

# 2. Install pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3.1 optional Sage attention support (30% faster)
# Windows only: extra step only needed for windows as triton is included in pytorch with the Linux version of pytorch
pip install triton-windows 
# For both Windows and Linux
pip install sageattention==1.0.6 


# 3.2 optional Sage 2 attention support (40% faster)
# Windows only
pip install triton-windows 
pip install https://github.com/woct0rdho/SageAttention/releases/download/v2.1.1-windows/sageattention-2.1.1+cu126torch2.6.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
# Linux only (sorry only manual compilation for the moment, but is straight forward with Linux)
git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention
cd SageAttention 
pip install -e .

# 3.3 optional Flash attention support (easy to install on Linux but may be complex on Windows as it will try to compile the cuda kernels)
pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1

```

Note pytorch *sdpa attention* is available by default. It is worth installing *Sage attention* (albout not as simple as it sounds) because it offers a 30% speed boost over *sdpa attention* at a small quality cost.
In order to install Sage, you will need to install also Triton. If Triton is installed you can turn on *Pytorch Compilation* which will give you an additional 20% speed boost and reduced VRAM consumption.

## Installation Guide for Linux and Windows for GPUs up to RTX50xx
RTX50XX are only supported by pytorch starting from pytorch 2.7.0 which is still in beta. Therefore this version may be less stable.\
It is important to use Python 3.10 otherwise the pip wheels may not be compatible.
```
# 0 Download the source and create a Python 3.10.9 environment using conda or create a venv using python
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9
conda activate wan2gp

# 1 Install pytorch 2.7.0:
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu128

# 2. Install pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3.1 optional Sage attention support (30% faster)
# Windows only: extra step only needed for windows as triton is included in pytorch with the Linux version of pytorch
pip install triton-windows 
# For both Windows and Linux
pip install sageattention==1.0.6 


# 3.2 optional Sage 2 attention support (40% faster)
# Windows only
pip install triton-windows 
pip install https://github.com/woct0rdho/SageAttention/releases/download/v2.1.1-windows/sageattention-2.1.1+cu128torch2.7.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl 

# Linux only (sorry only manual compilation for the moment, but is straight forward with Linux)
git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention
cd SageAttention 
pip install -e .
```

## Run the application

### Run a Gradio Server on port 7860 (recommended)

To run the text to video generator (in Low VRAM mode): 
```bash
python wgp.py
#or
python wgp.py --t2v #launch the default Wan text 2 video model
#or
python wgp.py --t2v-14B #for the Wan 14B model 
#or
python wgp.py --t2v-1-3B #for the Wan 1.3B model

```

To run the image to video generator (in Low VRAM mode): 
```bash
python wgp.py --i2v
```
To run the 1.3B Fun InP image to video generator (in Low VRAM mode): 
```bash
python wgp.py --i2v-1-3B
```

To be able to input multiple images with the image to video generator:
```bash
python wgp.py --i2v --multiple-images
```

Within the application you can configure which video generator will be launched without specifying a command line switch.

To run the application while loading entirely the diffusion model in VRAM (slightly faster but requires 24 GB of VRAM for a 8 bits quantized 14B model )
```bash
python wgp.py --profile 3
```

**Trouble shooting**:\
If you have installed Sage attention, it may seem that it works because *pip install sageattention* didn't produce and error or because sage is offered as on option but in fact it doesnt work :  in order to be fully operatioal Sage needs to compile its triton kernels the first time it is run (that is the first time you try to generate a video).

Sometime fixing Sage compilation is easy (clear the triton cache, check triton is properly installed) sometime it is simply not possible because Sage is not supported on some older GPUs

Therefore you may have no choice but to fallback to sdpa attention, to do so:
- In the configuration menu inside the application, switch "Attention mode" to "sdpa"
or
- Launch the application this way:
```bash
python wgp.py --attention sdpa
```

### Loras support


Lora for the Wan models are stored in the subfoler 'loras' for t2v and 'loras_i2v'. You will be then able to activate / desactive any of them when running the application by selecting them in the Advanced Tab "Loras" .

If you want to manage in different areas Loras for the 1.3B model and the 14B of Wan t2v models (as they are not compatible), just create the following subfolders:
- loras/1.3B
- loras/14B

You can also put all the loras in the same place by launching the app with the following command line (*path* is a path to shared loras directory):
```
python wgp.exe --lora-dir path --lora-dir-i2v path
```

Hunyuan Video and LTX Video models have also their own loras subfolders:
-loras_hunyuan
-loras_hunyuan_i2v
-loras_ltxv


For each activated Lora, you may specify a *multiplier* that is one float number that corresponds to its weight (default is 1.0) .The multipliers for each Lora should be separated by a space character or a carriage return. For instance:\
*1.2 0.8* means that the first lora will have a 1.2 multiplier and the second one will have 0.8. 

Alternatively for each Lora's multiplier you may specify a list of float numbers multipliers  separated by a "," (no space) that gives the evolution of this Lora's multiplier over the steps. For instance let's assume there are 30 denoising steps and the multiplier is *0.9,0.8,0.7* then for the steps ranges 0-9, 10-19 and 20-29 the Lora multiplier will be respectively 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7. 

If multiple Loras are defined, remember that each multiplier associated to different Loras should be separated by a space or a carriage return, so we can specify the evolution of multipliers for multiple Loras. For instance for two Loras (press Shift Return to force a carriage return):

```
0.9,0.8,0.7 
1.2,1.1,1.0
```
You can edit, save or delete Loras presets (combinations of loras with their corresponding multipliers) directly from the gradio Web interface. These presets will save the *comment* part of the prompt that should contain some instructions how to use the corresponding the loras (for instance by specifying a trigger word or providing an example).A comment in the prompt is a line that starts that a #. It will be ignored by the video generator. For instance:

```
# use they keyword ohnvx to trigger the Lora*
A ohnvx is driving a car
```
Each preset, is a file with ".lset" extension stored in the loras directory and can be shared with other users

Last but not least you can pre activate Loras corresponding and prefill a prompt (comments only or full prompt) by specifying a preset when launching the gradio server:
```bash
python wgp.py --lora-preset  mylorapreset.lset # where 'mylorapreset.lset' is a preset stored in the 'loras' folder
```

You will find prebuilt Loras on https://civitai.com/ or you will be able to build them with tools such as kohya or onetrainer.

### CausVid Lora

Wan CausVid is a distilled Wan model that can generate nice looking videos in only 4 to 12 steps. Also as a distilled model it doesnt require CFG and is two times faster for the same number of steps. 
The great thing is that Kijai (Kudos to him !) has created a CausVid Lora that can be combined with any existing Wan t2v model 14B like Wan Vace 14B to accelerate other models too. It is possible it works also with Wan i2v models. 

Instructions:
1) Download first the Lora: https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/blob/main/Wan21_CausVid_14B_T2V_lora_rank32.safetensors
2) Choose a Wan t2v model (for instance Wan 2.1 text2video 13B or Vace 13B ) 
3) Turn on the Advanced Mode by checking the corresponding checkbox
4) In the Advanced Generation Tab: select Guidance Scale =1, Shift Scale = 7
5) In the Advanced Lora Tab : Select the CausVid Lora (click the Refresh button at the top if you dont see it), and enter 0.3 as Lora multiplier
6) Now select a 12 steps generation and Click Generate

You can reduce the number of steps to as low as 4 but you will need to increase progressively at the same time the Lora muliplier up to 1. Please note the lower the number of steps the lower the quality (especially the motion).

You can combine the CausVid Lora and other Loras (just follow the instructions above)

### Macros (basic)
In *Advanced Mode*, you can starts prompt lines with a "!" , for instance:\ 
```
! {Subject}="cat","woman","man", {Location}="forest","lake","city", {Possessive}="its", "her", "his"
In the video, a {Subject} is presented. The {Subject} is in a {Location} and looks at {Possessive} watch.
```

This will create automatically 3 prompts that will cause the generation of 3 videos:
```
In the video, a cat is presented. The cat is in a forest and looks at its watch.
In the video, a man is presented. The man is in a lake  and looks at his watch.
In the video, a woman is presented. The woman is in a city and looks at her watch.
```

You can define multiple lines of macros. If there is only one macro line, the app will generate a simple user interface to enter the macro variables when getting back to *Normal Mode* (advanced mode turned off)

### VACE ControlNet introduction

Vace is a ControlNet that allows you to do Video to Video and Reference to Video (inject your own images into the output video). It is probably one of the most powerful Wan models and you will be able to do amazing things when you master it: inject in the scene people or objects of your choice, animate a person, perform inpainting or outpainting, continue a video, ... 

First you need to select the Vace 1.3B model or the Vace 13B model in the Drop Down box at the top. Please note that Vace works well for the moment only with videos up to 7s with the Riflex option turned on.

Beside the usual Text Prompt, three new types of visual hints can be provided (and combined !):
- *a Control Video*\
Based on your choice, you can decide to transfer the motion, the depth in a new Video. You can tell WanGP to use only the first n frames of Control Video and to extrapolate the rest. You can also do inpainting. If the video contains area of grey color 127, they will be considered as masks and will be filled based on the Text prompt of the reference Images. 

- *Reference Images*\
 A reference Image can be as well a background that you want to use as a setting for the video or people or objects of your choice that you want to inject in the video. You can select multiple reference Images. The integration of object / person image is more efficient if the background is replaced by the full white color. For complex background removal you can use the Image version of the Matanyone tool that is embedded with WanGP or use you can use the fast on the fly background remover by selecting an option in the drop down box *Remove background*. Becareful not to remove the background of the reference image that is a landscape or setting  (always the first reference image) that you want to use as a start image / background for the video. It helps greatly to reference and describe explictly the injected objects / people of the Reference Images in the text prompt.

- *a Video Mask*\
This offers a stronger mechanism to tell Vace which parts should be kept (black) or replaced (white). You can do as well inpainting / outpainting, fill the missing part of a video more efficientlty with just the video hint. For instance, if a video mask is white except at the beginning and at the end where it is black, the first and last frames will be kept and everything in between will be generated.



Examples:
- Inject people and / objects into a scene describe by a text prompt: Ref. Images + text Prompt
- Animate a character described in a text prompt: a Video of person moving + text Prompt
- Animate a character of your choice (motion transfer) : Ref Images + a Video of person moving + text Prompt
- Change the style of a scene (depth transfer): a Video that contains objects / person at differen depths + text Prompt


There are lots of possible combinations. Some of them require to prepare some materials (masks on top of video, full masks, etc...).

Vace provides on its github (https://github.com/ali-vilab/VACE/tree/main/vace/gradios) annotators / preprocessors Gradio tool that can help you build some of these materials depending on the task you want to achieve.

There is also a guide that describes the various combination of hints (https://github.com/ali-vilab/VACE/blob/main/UserGuide.md).Good luck ! 

It seems you will get better results with Vace if you turn on "Skip Layer Guidance" with its default configuration.

Other recommended setttings for Vace:
- Use a long prompt description especially for the people / objects that are in the background and not in reference images.  This will ensure consistency between the windows.
- Set a medium size overlap window: long enough to give the model a sense of the motion but short enough so any overlapped blurred frames do no turn the rest of the video into a blurred video
- Truncate at least the last 4 frames of the each generated window as Vace last frames tends to be blurry

**WanGP integrates the Matanyone tool which is tuned to work with Vace**.

This can be very useful to create at the same time a control video and a mask video that go together.\
For example, if you want to replace a face of a person in a video:
- load the video in the Matanyone tool
- click the face on the first frame and create a mask for it (if you have some trouble to select only the face look at the tips below)
- generate both the control video and the mask video by clicking *Generate Video Matting*
- Click *Export to current Video Input and Video Mask*
- In the *Reference Image* field of the Vace screen, load a picture of the replacement face

Please notes that sometime it may be useful to create *Background Masks* if want for instance to replace everything but a character that is in the video. You can do that by selecting *Background Mask* in the *Matanyone settings*

If you have some trouble creating the perfect mask, be aware of these tips:
- Using the Matanyone Settings you can also define Negative Point Prompts to remove parts of the current selection.
- Sometime it is very hard to fit everything you want in a single mask, it may be much easier to combine multiple independent sub Masks before producing the Matting : each sub Mask is created by selecting an  area of an image and by clicking the Add Mask button. Sub masks can then be enabled / disabled in the Matanyone settings.


### VACE, Sky Reels v2 Diffusion Forcing Slidig Window and LTX Video
With this mode (that works for the moment only with Vace, Sky Reels v2 and LTX Video) you can merge mutiple Videos to form a very long video (up to 1 min). 

When combined with Vace this feature can use the same control video to generate the full Video that results from concatenining the different windows. For instance the first 0-4s of the control video will be used to generate the first window then the next 4-8s of the control video will be used to generate the second window, and so on. So if your control video contains a person walking, your generate video could contain up to one minute of this person walking.

When combined with Sky Reels V2, you can extend an existing video indefinetely.

Sliding Windows are turned on by default and are triggered as soon as you try to generate a Video longer than the Window Size. You can go in the Advanced Settings Tab *Sliding Window* to set this Window Size. You can make the Video even longer during the generation process by adding one more Window to generate each time you click "Extend the Video Sample, Please !" button.

Although the window duration is set by the *Sliding Window Size* form field, the actual number of frames generated by each iteration will be less, because of the *overlap frames* and *discard last frames*: 
- *overlap frames* : the first frames of a new window are filled with last frames of the previous window in order to ensure continuity between the two windows
- *discard last frames* : sometime (Vace 1.3B model Only) the last frames of a window have a worse quality. You can decide here how many ending frames of a new window should be dropped.

There is some inevitable quality degradation over time to due to accumulated errors in calculation. One trick to reduce it / hide it is to add some noise (usually not noticable) on the overlapped frames using the *add overlapped noise* option. 


Number of Generated Frames = [Number of Windows - 1] * ([Window Size] - [Overlap Frames] - [Discard Last Frames]) +  [Window Size]

Experimental: if your prompt is broken into multiple lines (each line separated by a carriage return), then each line of the prompt will be used for a new window. If there are more windows to generate than prompt lines, the last prompt line will be repeated.

--lora-dir-hunyuan path : Path of directory that contains Hunyuan t2v Loras\
--lora-dir-hunyuan-i2v path : Path of directory that contains Hunyuan i2v Loras\
--lora-dir-ltxv path : Path of directory that contains LTX Video Loras\
--lora-preset preset : name of preset gile (without the extension) to preload
--verbose level : default (1) : level of information between 0 and 2\
--server-port portno : default (7860) : Gradio port no\
--server-name name : default (localhost) : Gradio server name\
--open-browser : open automatically Browser when launching Gradio Server\
--lock-config : prevent modifying the video engine configuration from the interface\
--share : create a shareable URL on huggingface so that your server can be accessed remotely\
--multiple-images : allow the users to choose multiple images as different starting points for new videos\
--compile : turn on pytorch compilation\
--attention mode: force attention mode among, sdpa, flash, sage, sage2\
--profile no : default (4) : no of profile between 1 and 5\
--preload no : number in Megabytes to preload partially the diffusion model in VRAM , may offer speed gains on older hardware, on recent hardware (RTX 30XX, RTX40XX and RTX50XX) speed gain is only 10% and not worth it. Works only with profile 2 and 4.\
--seed no : set default seed value\
--frames no : set the default number of frames to generate\
--steps no : set the default number of denoising steps\
--teacache speed multiplier: Tea cache speed multiplier,  choices=["0", "1.5", "1.75", "2.0", "2.25", "2.5"]\
--slg : turn on skip layer guidance for improved quality\
--check-loras : filter loras that are incompatible (will take a few seconds while refreshing the lora list or while starting the app)\
--advanced : turn on the advanced mode while launching the app\
--listen : make server accessible on network\
--gpu device : run Wan on device for instance "cuda:1"\
--settings: path a folder that contains the default settings for all the models\
--fp16: force to use fp16 versions of models instead of bf16 versions\
--perc-reserved-mem-max float_less_than_1 : max percentage of RAM to allocate to reserved RAM, allow faster transfers RAM<->VRAM. Value should remain below 0.5 to keep the OS stable\
--theme theme_name: load the UI with the specified Theme Name, so far only two are supported, "default" and "gradio". You may submit your own nice looking Gradio theme and I will add them

### Profiles (for power users only)
You can choose between 5 profiles, but two are really relevant here :
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3): loads entirely the model in VRAM if possible, slightly faster, but less VRAM available for the video data after that
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4): loads only the part of the model that is needed, low VRAM and low RAM requirement but slightly slower

You can adjust the number of megabytes to preload a model, with --preload nnn (nnn is the number of megabytes to preload)
### Other Models for the GPU Poor

- HuanyuanVideoGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/HunyuanVideoGP :\
One of the best open source Text to Video generator

- Hunyuan3D-2GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Hunyuan3D-2GP :\
A great image to 3D and text to 3D tool by the Tencent team. Thanks to mmgp it can run with less than 6 GB of VRAM

- FluxFillGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/FluxFillGP :\
One of the best inpainting / outpainting tools based on Flux that can run with less than 12 GB of VRAM.

- Cosmos1GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Cosmos1GP :\
This application include two models: a text to world generator and a image / video to world (probably the best open source image to video generator).

- OminiControlGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/OminiControlGP :\
A Flux derived application very powerful that can be used to transfer an object of your choice in a prompted scene. With mmgp you can run it with only 6 GB of VRAM.
